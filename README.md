ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Katie

-I recently graduated from Cambrian College with a Graduate Certificate in Cybersecurity. 

-Iâ€™m currently in the process of making a career transition from HR to IT. Can it be done? YES. I want to believe.

-Why? While working in HR, the IT team at work said "Oh, you wouldn't understand that part". Game on!

-I discovered TryHackMe last year and was immediately hooked even though I had no idea what I was doing. 

-Actively building skills in IT operations, technical support, and SOC analysis to pave my way into the cybersecurity field.

-My favorite thing? Playing around in my home lab and breaking things (intentionally, of course)

-Especially interested in digital forensics and unraveling how incidents happen

- Obsessed with OSINT at the moment 

-Big fan of Darknet Diaries and Digital Forensics Now

- Love and support organizations like Operation Safe Escape and Trace Labs
